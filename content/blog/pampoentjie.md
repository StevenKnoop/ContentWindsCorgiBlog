## Papa Pam
![bubbleboiv3.jpg](/bubbleboiv3.jpg)

Arrived at the airport two years ago on 31 October. This day happened to be Halloween, making his name (English translation “Pumpkin”) all the more fitting.

We arrived at the airport with excitement in our eyes, ready to collect Papa Pam. Once the staff brought him out we could not believe how big he was! At just 10 weeks old he already had a big structure, it was the cutest thing ever. His brother came down on the same flight, so they said their goodbyes before we headed home.

## Happy Beginnings

Papa Pam was a bit nervous and shy at the airport but once we arrived at home he immediately became curious and playful. We were worried about introducing him to the cats but that didn’t go too badly. Some mutual sniffing occurred and one of the cats immediately showed him who’s boss by giving him a tap on the nose. He let out a loud cry (a bit of an overreaction if you ask us) and knew not to mess with the cats too much.

Pam came home with lots of toys but the toy he was most interested in was the ball hanging from the cats’ scratching post. Of course. He could not stop bouncing this ball around and trying to bite it off. Too cute for words

Our families came over to meet this lovely new puppy and he could not get enough of all the attention. Shortly after he fell fast asleep… it was an exciting first day. We soon saw his first “sploot” as well.

## Puppy Training

The next few days consisted of potty training and lots of exploring. Corgi puppies need the bathroom much more often than adult Corgis. They are also still getting used to their bodies so they can be quite clumsy.

We also took Pam to puppy school which was a very interesting experience. It’s amazing to see all the things that these dogs can learn. Over time he became better at walking, he learned to do his business outside and we even taught him to sit and give paw for a treat.

Pam soon learned that he is quite the looker as taking him on walks always results in tons of compliments and pets from strangers. He has even had his photo taken a few times. It is honestly like walking with a celebrity sometimes.

Over the years Pam has become such a big part of our lives, he is with us all the time and brings us so much joy and laughs. He is kind, loyal, protective, clever and we wouldn’t give him up for the world.

We highly recommend bringing a Corgi into your lives, it will honestly bring you years and years of joy. Sign up for our waitlist [here](/waiting-list)
